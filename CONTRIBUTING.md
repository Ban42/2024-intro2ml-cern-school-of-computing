# Contributing Guide

I am happy to receive feedback, questions and concerns! If you like to contribute, please note that only `.py` scripts are the living content of this repo. All notebooks are generated by a dedicated GitHub Actions script at [`.github/workflows/create-notebooks.yml`](.github/workflows/create-notebooks.yml).
